# Hangman
My first official work on an all time classic - Hangman

The game has been developed in python3 mainly using the pygame module. I have only added only a few categories so far but I will most definitely add more as time goes on. This is the first official project which I have done without any help, so while it may not be the best, I am pretty happy with the way it turned out. As always feel free to let me know if you encounter any bugs or any problems at all during the game and let me know if I should make any changes. I will be updating the word lists sooner or later 

A huge shotuout to FlatIcon and FreePik.com and FreeSound for helping me with the resources I needed for this project. The links to all of these sites will be placed below for use of the audience.
